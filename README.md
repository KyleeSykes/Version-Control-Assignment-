Version control is a way to save your work in files and keep it organized while saving the history of your past changes to the assignment you are working on.
Git is a tool, in a way, it is the method of "transportation" you are using for the creation of your assignment, while GitHUb is the platform, like the "building" storing all your work and information on what you are making.
Git Status allows you to check what Git is seeing when you are running your code. Git Add is the first step towards saving your work to GitHUb, and it informs Git of what exactly you are wishing to commit to the repository. Git commit -m "message" saves your work with a small, about one sentence, remark on what you are saving/ what change to your work you have made. Git Push is the final step that ensures your work has been saved to your repository in GitHub.
